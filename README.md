# Inventory Management System

## Overview

This project is an Inventory Management System implemented in Java with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It connects with a database to manage and display inventory data.

## Features

- **User-friendly GUI:** The system provides an intuitive graphical interface for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes a database backend (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and manage inventory data efficiently.
- **Inventory Operations:** Supports operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and searching for inventory items.
- **Reporting:** Generates reports on inventory status, sales, trends, and more for analysis purposes.
- **Security:** Implements user authentication and authorization to control access and ensure data security.
- **Logging:** Logs system events and user actions for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** JavaFX or Swing
- **Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or your preferred database system
- **JDBC:** Java Database Connectivity for database interaction

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/inventory-management-system.git
   ```
2. Set up your database:
   - Create a database schema for the inventory system.
   - Configure database connection properties in the `application.properties` or similar file.
3. Import the project into your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
4. Resolve any dependencies required by your IDE or Maven/Gradle build tool.
5. Run the application main class (`Main.java` or similar) to start the system.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Log in using your credentials (if authentication is implemented).
3. Navigate through the GUI to perform inventory management tasks.
4. Generate reports or view inventory data as needed.
